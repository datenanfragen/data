# Company data for Datenanfragen.de

This repository contains a directory of contact information and privacy-related data on companies (and other organizations) under the scope of the EU GDPR, a directory of the supervisory data protection authorities, a collection of templates for GDPR requests in various languages and a list of suggested companies to send access requests to.  
It is used to power the Datenanfragen.de company database but we warmly welcome you to use the data for your own projects!

## Contributing

Due to the nature of the data we are collecting here, frequent changes, additions and deletions will be necessary. We invite you to contribute whatever information you have. You can add new records or edit existing ones directly through the [company database](https://www.datarequests.org/company/) on our website.  
If you want to edit many companies or do more involved edits, we recommend submitting pull requests directly to this repo (feel free to group changes to multiple records in a single PR). We have developed [this tool](https://company-json.datenanfragen.de/) to make generating valid JSON records easier.

You can chat with us through our [Matrix space](https://matrix.to/#/#datenanfragen:matrix.altpeter.me) and our [dedicated room for the company database](https://matrix.to/#/#dade-company:matrix.altpeter.me). Feel free to ask questions, pitch your ideas, or just talk with the community.

Please be aware that by contributing, you agree for your work to be released under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal license, as specified in the `LICENSE` file.

### Testing records

We have an automated testing script for the records. The script makes sure that all records follow our schema and catches common errors.

If you submit a PR, your changes will automatically be tested in our CI environment.

However, you can also run the script locally. To do so, first install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/). In the repository folder, run `yarn` to grab all necessary dependencies.  
This will automatically install a *pre-commit hook*: Whenever you commit your changes, the testing script will automatically run and check for errors.  
To use it manually, simply run `yarn test`.

## Data formats

The company data is located in the `companies` folder. Every company (or other organization) in our database is represented by a single JSON file (named after the slug in the JSON). The JSON has to follow the schema specified in the `schema.json` file. See [below](#company-records) for more details.

If a company requires a special template for requests under the GDPR, these can be stored in the `templates` folder and referenced by their filename in the company JSON record.

<details>
<summary>The <code>suggested-companies</code> are deprecated and will be removed soon.</summary>
The <code>suggested-companies</code> folder contains suggestions on which companies users should send access requests to. It is grouped by country (where each country is represented by a file with the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code as the filename). The list should only contain companies that the user should definitely request because they are relevant to pretty much every citizen of that country (e.g. collection agencies and credit agencies). It should not contain companies that are relevant for many but not all users (like Amazon, Facebook etc.)  
A list for a country is represented by a JSON array of the slugs representing the corresponding companies.
</details>

The `company-packs` folder contains bundles of related companies that are relevant to many users, grouped by country. See [below](#company-packs) for more details.

Finally, the `supervisory-authorities` folder contains data on supervisory data protection authorities. They are structured similarly to the company records, following the schema in the `schema-supervisory-authorities.json` file.

All JSON files must end with exactly one newline. All string fields in records must be trimmed (i.e. not have any leading or trailing whitespace).

## Company records

### Companies we are interested in

We are only interested in [companies that the GDPR applies to](https://www.datarequests.org/blog/gdpr-territorial-scope/). In practice, that means that the company either has to have an establishment in an EU country or the company has to deliberately process the data of people in the EU.

### Data sources

We prefer privacy-specific contact details (usually found in a company's privacy policy). In particular, email addresses like `privacy@example.com` or `dpo@example.org` and phone/fax numbers specifically of data protection officers are preferred. If no specific details are available, we use 'regular' contact details found on the company's website.

Records can contain personal data (like an email address that includes a person's name) if necessary. Please review the guidelines in [#1287](https://github.com/datenanfragen/data/issues/1287) beforehand.

Some companies don't publish adequate contact information on their website. In these cases, you can resort to third-party sources but do check the information very thoroughly depending on the source.

* For US companies that are Privacy Shield certified, the [Privacy Shield List](https://www.privacyshield.gov/list) is a valuable resource for uncovering missing contact information.
* Companies in the UK have their information listed in the [Companies House Search Register](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/).
* German companies are required by law to publish an 'Impressum' with their contact information. In addition to that, registered companies have to be listed in the [Handelsregister](https://www.handelsregister.de). This is a paid service but some information can be accessed for free.
* Companies in Singapore are assigned a unique entity number (UEN) and can be researched via the [Business Filing Portal of ACRA (BizFile)](https://www.bizfile.gov.sg).

### Addresses

We want the addresses to be formatted consistently, so don't just copy the information directly from the company's website. Try to format the address according to the standards of the respective country. For many countries, we already have records with examples on how to format the addresses. Otherwise, the Universal Postal Union has [resources](http://www.upu.int/en/activities/addressing/postal-addressing-systems-in-member-countries.html) on how to properly format addresses for many countries. In addition, there is a very [comprehensive guide](https://www.bitboost.com/ref/international-address-formats.html) offered by BitBoost Systems.  
Delimit the individual lines of the address by newlines and make sure that each line is trimmed. The last line of the address has to be the country, either in the country's native language or in English (we are using [this list](https://github.com/annexare/Countries/blob/master/dist/countries.csv) to determine the canonical names).

For incomplete addresses, you can use SmartyStreets' [Single Address Validation Tool](https://smartystreets.com/products/single-address).

For addresses in Hong Kong, the [Correct Addressing tool](https://www.hongkongpost.hk/correct_addressing/index.jsp?lang=en_US) offered by Hongkong Post, is very useful.

Please **don't** include lines like `Data protection officer`, `Privacy department` or similar. An 'Attn' line is always added automatically by our generator. The same applies to the company name, don't include that in the `address` field, either.

### Phone and fax numbers

We want phone and fax numbers to be in a standard international format without any other characters than numbers, the plus for the international prefix and spaces. You can use the [Phone Number Parser Demo](https://libphonenumber.appspot.com/) based on [libphonenumber](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/) to convert phone numbers to that format. Additional spaces may be inserted to improve readability.

### Required elements

If we know from previous requests (or from a privacy policy) which identification information is needed for requests to a company, we record that under the `required-elements` key.

If `required_elements` are specified, there must be one element with type `name`. This does not have to be a real name but could also be a username or even an email address, if no other information is required.  
In addition, the `required_elements` should include some way for the company to respond to the request, be it an address, an email address, a phone number or something similar. 

### Request language

Usually, the `request-language` should not be set, except for the following cases:

* If a record specifies a `custom-*-template` that isn't at least available in English, the `request-language` must be set to the language the template is available in.
* If both of the following conditions are met, the `request-language` should be set to the language from the first condition:
    1. The company in question only addresses consumers in one language.
    2. The `relevant-countries` for the company include ones where this language is not spoken.

### Relevant countries

If 'all' is specified, no additional country should be specified, as 'all' covers all countries.

## Company packs

The company packs are bundles of related companies that hold data on many people in a certain country, with the goal of making it easier for users to send requests to them. They supersede our previous lists of suggested companies.

For each supported country, there is a JSON file of the packs in the `company-packs` folder, named after the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code. Additionally, company packs that are relevant for users in all countries are in the `all.json` file.  
The JSON files follow the schema specified in `schema-company-packs.json`. They are an array of the company packs.

Each company pack has a `slug`, a `type` (where `add-all` means that all companies in the pack are relevant to the vast majority of users and they should all be immediately added, and `choose` means that it is likely that some companies are not relevant to all users and users should choose which companies they want to add), and finally `companies`, a JSON array of the slugs of the included companies.

One company can appear in multiple packs. Per-country packs are merged with an `all` pack with the same slug, if it exists. 

As being listed in a pack can have an effect on the number of requests a company receives, we need to be especially mindful here and only add companies that provably fit the pack and hold data on many people. For that reason, commits that change a pack must include sufficient documentation and sources in the commit message. Each source must have an archived link, preferably from archive.org. A single commit may only change a single pack.
