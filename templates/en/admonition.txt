To Whom It May Concern:

on {request_date} I sent you a request according to Article {request_article} GDPR.
{Description of the problem, for example: Unfortunately, I did not receive an answer so far. The period of one month, according to Article 12(3) sentence 1 GDPR is therefore exceeded.}

That is why I am contacting you again. After the arrival of this admonition, please adequately answer my request within two weeks. Otherwise, I am reserving the right to take legal action against you and to lodge a complaint with the responsible supervisory authority.

Thank you.

Yours sincerely,
