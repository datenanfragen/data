To Whom It May Concern:

A month ago, on {request_date}, I send you a request according to Article {request_article} GDPR. Unfortunately, I did not receive an answer so far. The period of one month according to Article 12 (3) 1 GDPR is therefore exceeded. Surely, my request has been held up in your daily business or is already on its way. Because of that I will extend the period.

After the arrival of this admonition, you will have additional two week to react upon it, otherwise I will contact the responsible supervisory authority.

Yours sincerely,
