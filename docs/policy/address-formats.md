# Address formats

We want our addresses to be formatted consistently and following the standards of the respective country. Below, you can find examples of the address formats we use by country. In some cases, they are incomplete and don't cover all cases. Many countries are also still missing. Feel free to open an issue so we can discuss how to handle those.

## Everything else

The list of countries here is not complete. If you need to format an address for an unlisted country, first try searching whether we already have any other records from the same country and use them as a guide.

Otherwise, try searching for the official guidelines by the respective national post service. The Universal Postal Union also has [resources](https://www.upu.int/en/Postal-Solutions/Programmes-Services/Addressing-Solutions#postal-addressing-systems-(pas)) on how to properly format addresses for many countries. In addition, there is a very [comprehensive guide](http://bitboost.com/ref/international-address-formats.html) offered by BitBoost Systems.

Consider opening an issue so we can discuss how to handle addresses for countries you come across if anything is unclear.
