# Identifying the right contact details

Our [goal](./scope.md) with the company database is to find the best possible contact details specifically for sending GDPR requests. Often, these will be obvious from the privacy policy, or there may be no specific contact details, in which case we fall back to general contact or support points.

It is unfortunately quite difficult to determine the right point of contact if the privacy policy lists both general contact details and those for a DPO, without mentioning which one requests should be addressed to. Different companies handle this differently, often without there being a way for us to tell. Sometimes, the DPO will be responsible for dealing with requests, other times they will only forward them somewhere else or even refuse to answer them at all. As such, we can unfortunately not formulate a general policy that will cover all cases. Everything not covered here will require a judgement call. If we later learn that we made the wrong call, we will correct the record accordingly.

When determining which point of contact to use, go through this list in order:

1. If the privacy policy explicitly says that requests should be sent to a certain contact, we use this contact.
1. If the privacy policy lists contact details for a privacy/data protection *team*, we use those.
1. If the privacy policy lists contact details for an *internal* DPO, we use those. Contact details for *external* DPOs should **not** be used unless the privacy policy explicitly says that requests should be sent to them.
1. If the privacy policy lists no contacts specifically for data protection, we use the official general contact details from the "Controller" section, the legal notice, or the terms of service, and if this doesn't exist either, we use general support contact details.
