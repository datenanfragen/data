# Purpose

We have built and are maintaining this company database for use in the [datarequests.org](https://www.datarequests.org) project to help users send GDPR requests to companies and other organizations. As a result, we collect the contact details that should be used for GDPR requests to the company in question.

The goal of the company database is not to collect all available data on a company, or even all data related to data protection practices of the company. Our goal is only to tell users where they should send requests to a company. We thus _only_ collect the preferred/suggested way to contact them for such purposes through each medium.

While we encourage external uses of our data, we do not have the maintenance capacity or interest to collect additional data beyond this. In particular, this means that we don't collect information like general customer service contact details, company registration numbers, CEOs, or any other data that is not directly relevant for GDPR requests. Refer to our [scope](./scope.md) for further details on that.
