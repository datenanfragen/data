# Reference

The pages in this folder are meant to serve as a reference for the different types of data we collect in this repository. You can consult them whenever something is unclear.

Currently, we have reference docs for the following:

* the [records in our company database](./companies.md), which are the heart of this repo
* [obsolete records](./obsolete-records.md), our mechanism for dealing with existing records that become obsolete or irrelevant and should be removed
* the [company packs](./company-packs.md), which offer suggestions to users on which companies they could send requests to
